#Object Oriented Programming.

The main actors in the object orirnted paradigm are called objects. Each object is an instance of a class. Each class represents the outside world in a consice and consistent view of the object that are instances of this class without going into too much unnecesary details or giving others access to the inner workings of the objects

While trying my hardest to grasp the knowledge surrounding the terminology "Object Oriented", I decided to at least attempt all the project exercises in this chapter.
